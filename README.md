This is a project to:-

(1) Convert Hand Gestures to Text language: Completed

(2) Convert Text language to Hand Gesture: In Progress

We are planning to provide the educational facilities that are already present to the deaf community. The primary focus is to make educational content available to all equally.

The idea is to create an app to translate text or speech to human understandable sign language.
It can translate Videos, Audio, Text, or Speech to Sign language.
This basically allows us to translate all the videos and audio which are basically inaccessible to the deaf community and help them study alongside others.
